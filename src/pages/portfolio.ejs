Travel Ahoy\'s main purpose is to provide users with travel information through different methods of traveling, but also their destination information with it. This format allows us to not only give our users multiple options, it also allows us to calculate the cheapest and fastest travel options for the user - giving them control to their preferred method of travel. Furthermore, Travel Ahoy provides different types of information such as: News (of your destination), Point of Interests, 7 day forecast of the weather, and a graph displaying the current covid condition. Finally, we give users the ability to plan their return date flights so that they can clearly plan out their vacation.';
